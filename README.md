## ðŸš€ About Me
Hi! I'm Gustavo Carrillo a Software Developer specialized in the Mobile Application Development with Flutter. I have a big passion for software development. I like contributing with ideas to bring solutions for everyday needs. In this project I present a solution for the technical case presented by Qualifacts so let's get started!
